Hi everyone,

Welcome back to school! ACM's first meeting will be next Thursday,
January 30th in Dunn 147 at 4pm. We will discuss t-shirts, our smart
room, and other fun things.

I also want to mention that MemphiSTEM is having their kick-off meeting
is next Friday (January 31) in Ball Hall 124 from 2:00pm - 3:30pm.

Finally, the Memphis Makers and Creators club on campus have some events
that everyone might be interested in. They have a Robotics on a Budget
event next Friday as well as a Plushie Customization on February 7th.

Hope everyone had a great first week and we'll see you next Thursday!


-Maria
